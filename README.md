# Introduction to Gigibox
Gigibox is a (half) optimized graphical interface capable of displaying the screen using two graphical buffers that switch per frame creating displayable sprites from custom formatted images and interpreting pseudo-assembly code able to access all available tools provided

# What powers it?
The graphics side of the project (drawing to the window n' stuff) is powered by SFML3, but it may get switched over to SDL3 in the future.

# Coming features
There are features that will be added as soon as possible. These are:
- Image/Sprite rework (IN PROGRESS)
    - ~~code rework~~
    - programs to convert to proprietary format (SCHEDULED)
